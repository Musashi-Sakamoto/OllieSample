Note that the location will be inaccurate if the robot slips or drifts while navigating.  When a Robot wakes up it has coordinates (0,0) and heading 0, which corresponds to facing down the positive Y-axis with the positive X-axis to your right. This command allows you to move Sphero to a new location and change the alignment of locator coordinates with IMU headings. */
